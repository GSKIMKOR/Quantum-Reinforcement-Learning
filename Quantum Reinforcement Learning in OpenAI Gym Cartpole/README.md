# Quantum Reinforcement Learning: CartPole with QDQN

This project implements a Quantum Deep Q-Network (QDQN) designed to solve the OpenAI Gym CartPole-v1 reinforcement-learning environment.
Instead of relying on a traditional classical neural network to approximate the Q-value function, the model integrates a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) built with PennyLane and PyTorch. The VQC acts as the function approximator within the DQN framework, enabling the agent to leverage parameterized quantum operations to represent complex decision boundaries.

## Overview
* **Environment:** OpenAI Gym `CartPole-v1`
* **Method:** Deep Q-Network (DQN) with Quantum Neural Network (QNN)
* **Tools:** PennyLane, PyTorch, Gym

## Configuration & Customization

You can modify the following variables in the code to change the environment or hyperparameters:

### 1. Changing the Environment
To solve a different problem (e.g., MountainCar), modify these variables in the code:
* **Environment Name:** Change `env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')` to your desired environment.
* **Input Dimension:** Update `x_dim = 4` to match the state space size of the new environment.
* **Action Space:** Update `n_qubits = 2` (and the circuit measurement) to match the number of actions.

### 2. Hyperparameters
* `learning_rate`: 0.0005
* `gamma`: 0.98 (Discount factor)
* `batch_size`: 32
* `n_layers`: 3 (Depth of quantum circuit)
* `epsilon`: Exploration rate (starts at 7%)

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. **Run the Notebook:**

* Open `QRL_Cartpole.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

* Click Run All cells.

3. **Monitor Training:**

* Training progress (Episode, Score, Epsilon) will be printed in the output.

* TensorBoard logs are saved in the tensorboard/ directory.

## Model Architecture
* Encoding: Angle Embedding (`RX` gates)

* Variational Circuit: `Rot` gates (trainable) + `CZ` gates (entanglement)

* Measurement: Pauli-Z expectation values represent Q-values.
